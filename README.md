# EinsteinDB

EinsteinDB is locality-critical causal consistent relativistic linearizable supercolumnar database with key-value, in-memory, append-log CacheCells. Indices are Stochastically arranged so as to treat every Event as a row-based addition with timestamp; the action gets translated into SQL/Postgres exploiting kleene closures of stateful semantics describing documents as objects which are in and out of themselves comprised of fibres. 

EinsteinDB is an eventful store with query-abstraction so as to not abide to strict Mvcc principles. Events can be totally ordered according to: irreflexive assertions, transitive retractions, and temporal mapping relations. The states of the "causets", used to construct the implemented object simultaneously. Two events may occur in opposite orders from the perspective of two "Observers". Intuitively, these phenomena occur because the speed of light in a vacuum appears the same to all observers irrespective of their relative motion or the motion of the light source.

A causet, to be more precise, is a discrete set of elements - the basic spacetime building blocks or "elementary events". But whereas in the continuum, spacetime is described, mathematically speaking, by an elaborate web of relationships among the point-events carrying information about contiguity, about smoothness, and about distances and times, for the elements of a causet the only relational information we have is what mathematicians call a "partial (or quasi-) order" - for some pairs x, y of elements (not for all!) we have the information that x comes before y, or, in other cases, that x comes after y. Physically, you should think of this ordering as a microscopic counterpart of the macroscopic relation of before and after in time: For some events, we know that they take place after certain other events. (The word "causal" comes in because we say that an event is later than another event if the latter could exert a causal influence on the former.)
